racktables-stuff
================

A small plugin for Racktables.org v0.20.4 only tested by me.

Just throw full_row_view.php in the the plugins directory of your
racktables installation and open a rack row in the racktables web
frontend, there should be a tab "Full Row View", enjoy.

Feedback is welcome!
