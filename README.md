racktables-stuff
================

A small plugin for Racktables.org v0.20.7 only tested by me.

# Installation

* just throw full_row_view.php, custom.php in the the plugins directory of your racktables installation
* create a css directory in the plugins directory and copy custom.css over
* you can apply a patch to wwwroot/inc/interface.php to rotate labels in vertical boxes (Blades and stuff)
* open a rack row in the racktables web frontend, there should be a tab "Full Row View", enjoy.

Feedback is welcome!
